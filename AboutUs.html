                            I've always been interested in computer science, ADA University was a top
                             contender for my study destination. Up until this semester,
                              this place allowed me to learn how to program in languages like C and Javascript.
                               I also learned HTML and CSS. That's why I'm at ADA University:
                                to expand my experience and develop as a professional programmer.
